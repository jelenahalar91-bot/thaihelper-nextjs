# Company Self-Service — Implementation Plan

**Status:** Planned, not started · **Created:** 2026-06-18
**Decision so far:** No "verified" badge for self-registration (see *Badge policy* below). Build only when the trigger conditions below are met.

## Goal

Let directory companies (agencies, service companies, lawyers, visa agents, MOU agencies, etc.) manage their own listing — claim it, edit details, upload a logo and photos — instead of the admin (Jelena) doing it by hand in Supabase.

Today: `/partners` is a "register interest" form → admin email → admin creates the listing manually. Listings are read-only and admin-managed.

## Two build stages

### 🟢 Stage 1 — "Claim / Edit" request (small, no login)

The cheap bridge that starts the inbound loop without an auth system.

1. Button on every directory detail page: **"Is this your business? Claim or update →"**
2. Links to a form (a variant of `/partners`), pre-filled with the listing name.
3. Company submits requested changes (logo URL, contact, description, …).
4. Admin gets an email → applies the change in Supabase.

- **Effort:** small — 1 button + 1 form + 1 API route, all mirroring the existing `/partners` + `/api/partner-signup` patterns.
- **Value:** companies find themselves and come to you → you only approve, instead of doing cold outreach. This is the "claim your listing" inbound mechanism (how Yelp / Google Business / Clutch bootstrapped).

### 🔵 Stage 2 — Company account + dashboard (large, real Phase 2)

Full self-service. Mirror the existing helper/employer account systems.

| Building block | What | Mirrors |
|---|---|---|
| **Auth (3rd role)** | Company login, cookie `th_biz_session`, JWT via `jose`, login by email + company ref (passwordless, like helpers/employers) | `lib/auth.js`, `pages/api/auth.js` |
| **DB** | `company_accounts` table + `owner_account_id` column on `directory_listings`; `pending`/`approved` status for edits | existing `scripts/supabase-*.sql` migrations |
| **Claim flow** | Company finds its listing → "Claim" → admin approves → listing linked to the account | — |
| **Dashboard** (`/business-dashboard`) | Edit listing (description, LINE, WhatsApp, opening hours, specialties, nationalities…) + **upload logo / photos** | `pages/profile.js`, `pages/api/photo.js` + `bufferMatchesMime()` from `lib/file-magic.js` |
| **Storage** | Logo + gallery → Supabase Storage bucket, magic-byte validation | existing photo uploads |
| **Moderation** | Edits land as `pending` → admin approves (or auto-publish + spot-check) | — |
| **Emails** | Verification email on signup, "edit approved" notification | Resend |

- **Effort:** large — comparable to the whole helper-account system (several API routes, a dashboard page, auth, DB migrations, storage, moderation).

## Recommended sequence

1. **Now:** build nothing — manual editing via Supabase is fine at low listing volume.
2. **When manual editing gets painful** (more listings) **or to kick off inbound:** build Stage 1 (claim/edit form) — cheap bridge.
3. **When monetising** (~1 year out): build Stage 2 (accounts + dashboard) — only then does the auth investment pay off.

## Badge policy (decided 2026-06-18)

- **No badge for self-registration.** Self-registering is not verification — anyone can fill a form. We removed the old "verified" badge precisely because the site doesn't vet providers and it conflicted with the "we do not endorse" disclaimer. Do not recreate that false-trust signal.
- **Honest options for later:**
  - **"Claimed" / "Managed by the company"** — for any company with an account managing its own profile. Truthful (they literally manage it), useful freshness signal. Free.
  - **"Verified"** — reserve for when something real is checked (DBD company-registration number, a license). This becomes a genuine trust tier **and** a paid "Verified Business" premium feature. The `verified` field is already in the DB (just hidden), so re-enabling it later loses no data.
